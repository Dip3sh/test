## 10. Basic Accounting Conventions

Accounting conventions are the guidelines that govern the accounting practices and help in maintaining consistency and comparability in financial statements. The basic accounting conventions include:

1. **Convention of Consistency**: This principle states that once an accounting method is adopted, it should be used consistently throughout unless a change is warranted and disclosed.

2. **Convention of Full Disclosure**: All relevant financial information should be disclosed in the financial statements to ensure that users can make informed decisions.

3. **Convention of Materiality**: This principle allows accountants to disregard certain accounting rules if the amount involved is not significant enough to affect the decision-making of users.

4. **Convention of Prudence**: This convention advises caution in financial reporting, ensuring that assets and income are not overstated, and liabilities and expenses are not understated.

5. **Convention of Going Concern**: This assumes that a business will continue to operate indefinitely unless there is evidence to the contrary.
