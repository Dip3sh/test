| Price (PX) | Quantity Demanded (units) |
|------------|---------------------------|
| 100        | 100                       |
| 80         | 200                       |
| 60         | 300                       |
| 40         | 400                       |
| 20         | 500                       |
| 10         | 600                       |


Step 1: Identify the Prices and Quantities

We need to calculate the price elasticity of demand for the rise in price from Rs 60 to Rs 80.

- At P=60, Qd​=300

- At P=80, Qd​=200

Step 2: Calculate the Changes

- Change in quantity demanded (ΔQ):
ΔQ=Qd​(80)−Qd​(60)
=200−300
=−100

- Change in price (ΔP):
ΔP=P(80)−P(60)
=80−60
=20

Step 3: Calculate the Average Quantity and Average Price

- Average quantity (Qavg​):
Qavg​=2Qd​(80)+Qd​(60)​
=2200+300​
=250

- Average price (Pavg​):
Pavg​=2P(80)+P(60)
​=280+60
​=70

Step 4: Calculate the Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

Using the arc elasticity formula:
PED=ΔP/Pavg​ΔQ/Qavg​​

Substituting the values:
PED=20/70−100/250​

Calculating each part:

- ΔQ/Qavg​=
- −100/250
- =−0.4

- ΔP/Pavg​=20/70
- ≈0.2857

Now substituting back into the PED formula:
PED=0.2857−0.4​

≈−1.4

Conclusion

The price elasticity of demand when the price rises from Rs 60 to Rs 80 is approximately -1.4. This indicates that the demand is elastic, meaning that the quantity demanded is relatively responsive to price changes.
